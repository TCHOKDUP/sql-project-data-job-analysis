# Background
The demand for data analysts has skyrocketed as companies across industries rely on data to make smarter decisions and stay ahead. Data analysts are the ones who take messy data, clean it up, and turn it into insights that businesses can actually use. It’s a role that’s become a huge deal in today’s world, and I’ve always been fascinated by the impact it has.
I started this project because I wanted to dig deeper into what it takes to be a data analyst—what skills are in demand, how salaries vary, and which industries are hiring. By analyzing real-world data, I hope to uncover trends and patterns that not only help me understand the job market better but also offer some guidance to others interested in this field.
### The questions I wanted to answer through my project were:

1. What are the top paying Data Analyst job?
2. What skills are required for top paying Data Analyst jobs?
3. What are the most in demand skills for data analysts?
4. What are the top skills based on salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn(optimal:high demand and high paying)?

The data for this project is taken from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's filled with insights on job market regarding the positions, salaries and many more

# Tools I Used
To analyze the data and build insights about the job market for data analysts, I utilized the following tools:

- **SQL:** SQL was used to query, filter, and manipulate the data. Its ability to efficiently handle structured datasets made it an essential tool for this project, helping to extract meaningful insights from the raw data.

- **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database system, served as the backbone for storing and managing the dataset. It provided advanced querying capabilities and excellent support for handling large datasets.

- **VS Code:** Visual Studio Code was my primary code editor for writing SQL queries and managing the project. Its extensions and integrated tools made development smoother and more efficient.

- **Git:** Git was used for version control, enabling me to track changes, experiment with different approaches, and maintain a clear history of my work.

- **GitHub:** GitHub served as the platform to host and share my project. It allowed me to collaborate (if needed), showcase my work, and make it easily accessible to others interested in the findings.
